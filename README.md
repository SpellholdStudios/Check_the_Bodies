## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

Check the Bodies adds various quests to the BGII part of the game, including new areas, a new city, spells, stores, animations, and items: This is a mini-quest mod, each single quest works as a stand alone quest. That is to say, if one were to start a new game, play one of my new quests, and finish the game, there should be no problems. Each quest is heavily dependant on a number of random factors: the PC's race, class, alignment, etc., chapter, make up of the party, and so many other factors. It will be impossible for a single character to play through the entire game and get *all* of Check The Bodies' quests. That is by design. Don't worry, no matter what you choose for a character, you won't miss anything for that character.

For a list of the quests, see "<a href="CtB/Readme/CtB_Quest_List.txt">CtB_Quest_List.txt</a>". (In CtB/Readme) For Charles Bisson's original notes, please refer to "<a href="old_CtB-Readme_old.txt">old_CtB-Readme_old.txt</a>".

**Key features:**
- More than 20 independent new quests, dozens of class specific quests.
- 160 areas, 15 new areas. 1 new town.
- 1 new NPC.
- 450 new creatures.
- Hundreds of new items.
- 275 spells.
- 25 stores.
- 6 new songs.
- 1 film.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with or without the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

Check The Bodies is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. However, we cannot test every single one. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/196-check-the-bodies/">report them on the forum</a>!

>Classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-ctb.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **ctb** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Check The Bodies for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: ctb folder and a setup-ctb.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-ctb.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-ctb.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

Check The Bodies for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: ctb folder, setup-ctb and setup-ctb.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-ctb.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-ctb.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Check The Bodies for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`WeInstall setup-ctb`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine BGMain.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-ctb --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="components" id="components"></a>Components

The installer includes the following components. The number of each is the component *DESIGNATED* number which gives it a fixed install position, lets other components and mods detect it and allows automated installers to specify component choices.  
All optional components require the main component (they need to since it's the one that installs new content).<br /><br />


#### 0. Check the Bodies: main component

This component installs the mod itself.</br>

## 

#### 1. Candlekeep Chores

This component adds the so called "*Candlekeep Chores*" which will trigger inside the library of Irenicus' Dungeon. The PC will be back in Candlekeep, remembering his/her chores during his normal life in Candlekeep. These chores have to be executed in length if the component "Candlekeep Chores Fast Foreward" is not installed. Each finished chore will grant the PC an ability.

## 

#### 2. Candlekeep Chores Fast Forward (by hlidskialf)

This component requires the *Candlekeep Chores* component to be installed. It gives the possibility to shorten the Candlekeep Chores and allows you to bypass all the chores and lectures during the initial part of the Check the Bodies mod while still retaining the options for the various abilities that you had the opportunity to learn.

When you speak to Gorion after first appearing in Candlekeep, just ask him to "*skip*" the lectures and chores. It should work at almost any point along the days of chores, so long as they are not done for the day. The rest should be pretty straightfoward. I left in CBisson's rebuilt cutscenes from BG1 as I respect the work he did for the mod, as well as it's just a cool series of flashbacks. I hope this will help others enjoy the mod without having to endure the labors of childhood in a cRPG.

## 

#### 3. Other Improvements

This component patches the main component with some improvements:
- Change the entrances of AR0404.are to the original position.
- Change Yusef's name to Yassir, because Yusef is Surayas brother.
- Start the pirate quest in Athkathla at the gates by level 10.

##

#### 4. Biffing

This component requires the main component to be installed. Compress files for better game performance. Only valid for classic (BG2:ToB or BGT) game.</br>
