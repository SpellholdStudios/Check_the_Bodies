@650403 = ~Drakkas Ranul was an outcast Moon Elf with a huge chip on his shoulder.  At a very young age, Drakkas was kidnapped by a Drow raiding party and brought up by the Drow to be a pit fighter.  At first he fought his fellow kidnap victims in the pits.  However, over time, his fellow abductees died from their wounds and poor treatment, thus leaving Drakkas alone to eventually fight monsters of the Drow's choosing.  Drakkas persevered, fueled by his ever-growing hatred for his captors, the hopes of one day escaping and then taking revenge on his kidnappers.

One day Drakkas got his wish - he was able to escape by stealing his jail cells keys from his lazy night guard, and then stealthfully slipping out into the unforgiving Underdark.  He managed to steal a couple of scimitars on his way out, whichy he put to good use while while circumventing the twisted corridors of the Underdark.  When he emerged on the surface, he immediately sought out his Moon Elf kin.

Unfortunately, when he found his kin, they ostracized him due to his horrendous battle scars.  Embittered and outcast, he made it his mission in life to exact the most painful revenge possible on his kidnappers.  Drakkas diligently trained in the dark magics, and continued his formidable weapons training as well.  When he got to the point where he felt he was ready, he began to sell his services as a mercenary to earn coin and buy better equipment. One thing in particular he eventually wanted was lightweight chain mail to actually enhance his fighting ablities.  Luck was with him the day he found a Dwarven armorsmith who could accommodate Drakkas' needs.  It was not long after until the armor was finished and Drakkas was ready for his mission of revenge.

Drakkas disappeared from the people who knew him and utilized his mercenary services, and ventured into the depths of the Underdark, where he never heard from again.  However, his special armor did somehow make it out of the Underdark.  No one knows how, but speculation has it that the return of Drakkas' chain mail to the surface world was a subtle message from the Drow.  The message, of course, was left to the imagination of the interpreter.

The oldest of dwarves speak of dykhast blades with tears of fond remembrance in thier eyes, and callously spit at the mention of the "sundry weak and piddling" metals that today's arms and armor are fashioned from.

There are rumors, though, of an ancient and secret temple called Chogoh Kyn - it is there, the tales say, that blades of dykhast are still made in the fashion of days long past.  The price may be high, but for the true connoisseur, there is no matching the glory, the perfection, the utter joy... of dykhast.

When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel.  Having reached this end, weaponers began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain polearm types.  This spear is slightly different though, as it has physical improvements.  The head has a few small barbs to increase damage as the head is removed from a victim and the length of the shaft has been reinforced with rings of steel to prevent the wood from splitting and which have small blades projecting at various angles.  The butt end has a molded steel cap which can be used as a blunt weapon.

It has no known traps or defenses, but the brass clasps and ornate circlets prove that it is the lost spellbook of Desmondal.

Desmondal was a dignified mage of Athkatla who perished some seventy winters ago of a winter fever.  His effects were sold by a merchant of Amn, Oristel- almost certainly after several mages had been allowd to copy individual spells from the Libram upon payment of stiff fees.  The purchaser of the Libram and his present whereabouts, are unknown.

In the Libram of Desmondal are ten spells, which follow below, that can be memorized per the normal requirements.  When each spell is memorized, it can be cast from memory normally, however, the spell will remain within the tome unlike a scroll which would be destroyed in the process.

The Libram, despite the fact that the spell may have been memorized by a character, must be read from in order to cast the spell.  To do so, simply equip the spell book in your shield slot, and access the spells as a Item ability.

  Luck
  Skull Trap
  Minor Globe of Invulnerability

  Energy Drain
Note that unused spells are 'lost', but not removed from the spellbook for a particular rest cycle; the spells are not cumulative.  Spells from Desmondal's Spellbook are cast as if by a 9th level Wizard.

@650613 = ~This great shield, along with its companion weapon, the Sword of Belvin, has a long and nearly illustrious history.

During the Year of the Spreading Spring, drastic and sudden climate changes quickly took place across the western Heartlands of Faerûn.  Widespread drought was brought about by a short rainy season and an unpleasantly warm summer.  The water level of the Farsea Lake dropped until its edges were boggy and marshy, with an abundance of reeds.  The great desert Anauroch extend its boundaries southward.

More than three hundred years ago, as the desert marched south, so did the goblins.  During the winter of 1089, Izac Uthor gathered the goblin armies near the abandoned village of Thandril, on the norwestern edge of the Goblin Marches.  The host included nigh unto 200,000 goblins, tens of thousands of affiliated orcs and kobolds, and a few thousand hobgoblins leading detachemnets of goblins or orcs.  Of course, even a force of more than a quarter million combatants could hardly hope to conquer, much less ocuppy, the entire Western Realms north of the Fields of the Dead.  Many tense discussions were held in Cormyr, Hills Edge, Tilverton, Soubar, Shadowdale, and other places in harm's way.

Regular troops and the local militias were sent to Hill's Edge to join the main battle force uniting against the goblinoid horde.  They  came from Beregost, Bladur's gate, Berdusk, Iriaebor, Elturel, Scornubel, Soubar, and the Reaches of the High Moor.  No souner than all the forces arrived than a leader was found:  Artur Blevin, commander of the home forces of Soubar.  Belvin's shield was carried by him as the troops on both sides assembled on the plain before dawn; all fought wherever they found their foe.  Belvin slew more than three score of the goblin horde, yet it was to no avail.  Among Artur Blevin's troops, none escaped unscathed.

After the Battle of Bones, the shield was lost and records of particular owners become sketchy.  Yet centuries later, the shield finally resurfaced to knowledge, this time in the hands of a maurading orcan band.  The shield was recovered by guards on a caravan making its way from Waterdeep to Scornubel, but the caravan was ambushed prior to completing its trade run by a larger and better equipped orcan and half-orcan group of bandits, and became the property of a ruthless half-orc by the name of Sureblade.  How the shield ended up in this ancient Wizards Tower is unknown.

This shield is truly an item that should be treasured, as it is bound to save the life of one who carries it more than once adventures take it throughout Faerûn.  This shield decreases AC by 6 and adds 3 to all saving throws.  In addition, Belvin's shield allows one to move so quickly that the movement rate of the carrier is increased by 2 and normal missiles have no chance of striking.

@650615 = ~This great warsword, along with its companion shield, the Shield of Belvin, has a long and nearly illustrious history.

During the Year of the Spreading Spring, drastic and sudden climate changes quickly took place across the western Heartlands of Faerûn.  Widespread drought was brought about by a short rainy season and an unpleasantly warm summer.  The water level of the Farsea Lake dropped until its edges were boggy and marshy, with an abundance of reeds.  The great desert Anauroch extend its boundaries southward.

More than three hundred years ago, as the desert marched south, so did the goblins.  During the winter of 1089, Izac Uthor gathered the goblin armies near the abandoned village of Thandril, on the norwestern edge of the Goblin Marches.  The host included nigh unto 200,000 goblins, tens of thousands of affiliated orcs and kobolds, and a few thousand hobgoblins leading detachemnets of goblins or orcs.  Of course, even a force of more than a quarter million combatants could hardly hope to conquer, much less ocuppy, the entire Western Realms north of the Fields of the Dead.  Many tense discussions were held in Cormyr, Hills Edge, Tilverton, Soubar, Shadowdale, and other places in harm's way.

Regular troops and the local militias were sent to Hill's Edge to join the main battle force uniting against the goblinoid horde.  They  came from Beregost, Bladur's gate, Berdusk, Iriaebor, Elturel, Scornubel, Soubar, and the Reaches of the High Moor.  No souner than all the forces arrived than a leader was found:  Artur Blevin, commander of the home forces of Soubar.  Belvin's sword, this great warblade, was carried by him as the troops on both sides assembled on the plain before dawn; all fought wherever they found their foe.  Belvin slew more than three score of the goblin horde, yet it was to no avail.  Among Artur Blevin's troops, none escaped unscathed.

After the Battle of Bones, the great warblade was lost and records of particular owners become sketchy.  Yet centuries later, the sword finally resurfaced to knowledge, this time in the hands of a maurading orcan band.  The sword was recovered by guards on a caravan making its way from Waterdeep to Scornubel, but the caravan was ambushed prior to completing its trade run by a larger and better equipped orcan and half-orcan group of bandits, and became the property of a ruthless half-orc by the name of Sureblade.  How the sword ended up in this ancient Wizards Tower is unknown.

This sword is truly a weapon worthy the finest fighting skills, as it allows the weilder to cut through the defenses of most other creatures.  Upon a successful hit against a target of 18th level of less, the creature is instantly killed when struck, an ability which can be quite useful when forced to fight powerful enemies.

@650625 = ~This harp, a delicate musical instrument, was found within the Harper Stronghold in Athkatla.  Its music is soothing, yet when the strings are plucked in a particular order, the harp allows a bard to instill the ability for his companions to enhance their own self-control and privacy, shielding themselves from almost any mental effect - Charm, Command, Dominate Person, Fear, Feeblemind, and any scrying by crystal balls or other divination methods.

@650627 = ~Much more than the common time telling devices found throughout the Realms, this one upon a cursory inspection is made of two bulbs of glass joined by a narrow passage, which tells time with a grain of sand that falls between the two bulbs.  However, inspecting the engravings on the base, this Hourglass has the ability to suspend time for its user briefly, allowing actions to be taken.

@650628 = ~This potent weapon was created by the smiths of ancient Myth Drannor.  Moonblades are used in the long process of selecting a ruler for the isle of Evermeet.  A Moonblade chooses its owner, and in the case of this sword it has chosen the Harper Ranger, Julian Nonnel.  Only Julian can use this blade, anyone else who tries will find themselves unable to lift the sword.  This particular Moonblade gives resistance to fire and gives its user a bonus to his armor class.

@650629 = ~This is the morningstar of Kiel the Legion-Killer, first-born son of Durlag Trollkiller and Clan-prince of his father's ill-fated tower. He was wielding it in his final hour as he rushed to warn his father of the doppelgangers' infiltration of their Clan-home. It is said that the intensity of his rage in these final moments permanently imprinted itself upon the weapon. All who wield it are overcome with this battle anger whenever an enemy is sighted.

Apparently, the morningstar was recovered from the dungeon of Durlag's and brought to the Harper Stronghold in Athkatla for safekeeping.  Since it's recovery, the value of the weapon has increased dramatically.

Mat Savasta, one of the most talented burglars on the Sword Coast, wore this helm on many of his scores.  The helm, a simple leather coif, enhanced Mat's already impressive lock picking abilities.  In the cities of Waterdeep, Luskan, Neverwinter, Baldur's Gate, Athkatla, or Calimport, there wasn't a door that could not be unlocked by Mat.  To activate the helm, the proper command word must be known at which point a burst of energy magically shapes itself into that of a key that closely fits the lock.

The numerous studs form a flexible coat of metal that helps to turn aside slashing and cutting attacks, while the leather is little more than a means of securing the rivets in place.

The ninja-to is short with a straight blade, making it ideal for the subterfuge of the ninja.  The ninja-to is also more suited to fighting in closed places, sometimes giving the ninja an advantage over the longer blades that the samurai used.

@660204 = ~The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword.  Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons.  In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened.  Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword.  The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.

@661027 = ~The mission of King Azoun's army is a simple one: defend Cormyr. The realization of that goal, however, is complex.  To enforce the royal word, Cormyr maintains a large standing army, which has increased dramatically in the last decade.  There are more than 12,000 Purple Dragons (so-called because of their banner) garrisoned in the major cities and fortifications, a mounted force of 500 warriors trained in sword and bow, led by 30 knights out of the Royal Court. Most of these elite units are veterans of the Crusade against the Horde, and are members of the Order of the Golden Way, a military award commemorating those battles.

An important function of the Purple Dragons is to ensure peace throughout the kingdom of Cormyr.  This means keeping the interior safe from raiding parties so a merchant company or farmer may travel in safety and return home with profits intact.  To this end the Purple Dragons have been very successful. Certainly, the Purple Dragons cannot be everywhere at once, and there is always the threat of a random bandit attack somewhere in Cormyr, but the kingdom does have the reputation of offering safe overall travel.

The Purple Dragons are also charged with preventing internal insurrection. There has been only one instance when the Purple Dragons were needed to quell an insurrection, when they put down the revolt by Gondegal without bloodshed.
