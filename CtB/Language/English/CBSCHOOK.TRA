@3   = ~(The woman looks up into your eyes, smiles sadly, but says nothing)~
@4   = ~(The woman, instead of speaking, puts her hand on your shoulder and gently pushes you away)~
@5   = ~(The woman turns away from you, apparently not able to express herself)~
@6   = ~If you don't tell me what's wrong, how can I help you?~
@7   = ~I don't know what it is that you need, but I'm sure there is something.~
@8   = ~It's polite to answer someone when they speak to you.~
@9   = ~(The woman again only smiles sadly, then quickly gestures with her index finger upon her lips)~
@10  = ~You want me to be quiet?  Why?~
@11  = ~I wasn't yelling, was I?~
@12  = ~You can't speak!  That's what the problem is!~
@13  = ~(The woman laughs silently.  She shakes her head and points to herself.)~
@14  = ~(The woman looks at you curiously.  The woman again gestures with her index finger upon her lips while pointing to herself)~
@15  = ~(The woman only nods her head once)~
@16  = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@17  = ~Were you born mute?~

@24  = ~(The woman looks at you, waiting expectantly)~

@26  = ~(The woman repeats the gesture, this time more insistantly)~
@27  = ~Can you write?~
@28  = ~I don't understand?  What does this mean?~

@31  = ~(The woman, upon hearing your question, brightens significantly.  She nods her head, excited)~
@32  = ~(The woman points to your backpack, quickly miming the act of scribing)~
@33  = ~I don't have anything to write on.~
@34  = ~Here, I have some parchment and charcoal here.  Write what it is you need me to know.~
@35  = ~Wait, here.  I have some expensive vellum that you can use to write on.~
@36  = ~(The woman points out to the bar, apparently ordering you to find something to write upon)~
@37  = ~(The woman pauses for a moment, and bends down to write on the parchment.  After a few minutes of writing, she gives you the scroll and smiles hopefully)~
@38  = ~(The woman pauses for a moment, and carefully begins to write on the expensive sheet of vellum.  After a few minutes, she gives you the paper and smiles hopefully)~
@39  = ~(The woman looks at you, her eyebrows raised and she nods her head quickly, as if to ask if you will help her)~
@40  = ~Of course I will help you.  I'll try and find these wizards, and see if they will undo what they did to you.~
@41  = ~I'll help, but I hope that this if going to be worth it, if you know what I mean.~
@42  = ~Against my better judgement, I'll help you, but I think you brought this upon yourself.~
@43  = ~You should be ashamed of yourself.  There isn't any way I'd help you get out of this.~
@44  = ~I'm sorry, but I don't know if I'd be able to do what you ask.  Maybe someone else could help you?~
@45  = ~(The woman smiles and starts waving you off, as if to hurry you along.~
@46  = ~(The woman grins, glances at you sidelong, then nods.  Seems as if you help her, you've got to get the road dust and dungeon smell out of your clothes)~
@47  = ~(The woman nods, ashamed, but looks in your eyes and smiles)~
@48  = ~(The woman sinks to the floor, her hands outstretched to you)~
@49  = ~No.  I will not help a harlot and a blackmailer.  Goodbye.~
@50  = ~Very well.  I will help you.  But you had better learn your lesson.~
@51  = ~(The woman looks behind you, then around the room.  She shrugs her shoulders and indicates that no one else is around)~
@52  = ~(The woman smiles at you, and places her index finger upon her lips.  She then indicates for you to go)~
@53  = ~No, wait, I found the ones who cursed you so.~

@58  = ~(The woman says nothing and you continue)~
@59  = ~I've explained to them that if you were to get your speech back, you would leave Athkatla and Amn for good.~
@60  = ~The wizards insisted that they wouldn't give you your speech back, unless you were dead.~
@61  = ~(The woman's brow furrows, and she is visibly upset)~
@62  = ~This is the best that they would do.  If you want to speak again, you need to leave the city.  Will you do this?~
@63  = ~(The woman looks at you, and nods once)~
@64  = ~Good.  I will tell them what you have decided.~
@65  = ~(The woman's brow furrows, and she moves a step back from you)~
@66  = ~No, not like that.  I thought we could make it appear for you to die, and I could take you somewhere so that no one could find you.~
@67  = ~(The woman looks at you sidelong, and shakes her head.  Obviously she does not like the idea)~
@68  = ~(The woman opens her mouth to speak, but no sound is issued)~
@69  = ~(The woman opens her mouth to speak)  Oh!  Thank you!  Thank you!! I can speak again!~
@70  = ~Great.  Come on, we've got to get you out of the city and Amn.  Where do you want to go?~
@71  = ~I hadn't thought about that.  What do you think?~
@72  = ~You could go to Waterdeep.~
@73  = ~You could go hide from the world in Icewind Dale.~
@74  = ~I think you should go to Neverwinter.  I hear the nights there are exciting.~
@75  = ~Perhaps you could go to Shadowdale.~
@76  = ~I've always heard that Cormyr is nice.~
@77  = ~Maybe you could go south, to Calimshan?~
@78  = ~The islands of Moonshae are a pleasant place to live.~
@79  = ~No, I wouldn't like it there.~
@80  = ~Cormyr?  I've heard nice things about that kingdom.  Yes, that is where I will go.~
@81  = ~I think I might even like it there.~
@82  = ~Well, you'd better hurry and be on your way.  You have less than one hour to get the stuff you need and set out.~
@83  = ~Yes, I will get on my way.  Thank you again for what you have done.  Perhaps we may meet again.~
@84 = ~Helping Melynda the Mute

I met a pretty young woman today, who unfortunately could not speak.  She could write, and I gave her something to write on.  She wrote that she had been cursed by some wizards, and that she is unhappy now.  I told her that I would try to help, and I will have to hunt for the offending wizards.~
@85 = ~Helped Melynda

I was able to convince both the Cowled Wizards and Melynda to reach a better solution for their problems.  The Cowls restored Melynda's speech, and Melynda promised to leave Amn.  She is headed to Cormyr, and I wish her happiness now.~
